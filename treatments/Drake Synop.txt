The music video for "Energy" features Drake transformed into several notable celebrities, including: television personality Oprah Winfrey, during her famous interview with Tom Cruise; professional boxer Floyd Mayweather, Jr.; singer Justin Bieber, from a Calvin Klein advertisement; singer Miley Cyrus, from her own music video for "Wrecking Ball"; former mayor of Toronto, Rob Ford, enjoying crack cocaine in an alley; entertainer Kanye West, during the filming of his own music video for "Bound 2"; United States President Barack Obama, during a presidential address; and O.J. Simpson, during the high speed car chase that led to his arrest. In each of these iterations, Drake mimes along with the song. Interspersed with these clips is monochromatic footage of Drake and his entourage; along with portraits of other caricatures. Bookending the video, a child version of Drake is seen in a field with other children, who act not unlike bullies towards him. At the end of the video, the young Drake stands solitary in the field, while another child (who has now been revealed to have Drake's adult face) points a toy gun at him.
