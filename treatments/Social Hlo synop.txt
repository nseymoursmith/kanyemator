The writer Tao Lin wakes up in his Manhattan apartment, the setting of his novel Taipei. He wakes up, checks his emails and his phone, then he gets dressed and leaves. 

Suddenly the quality of the picture drops - Tao is now walking around New York City in grainy, webcam footage. The camera pans out, and we see that he is being watched on a computer screen. The person watching is Emmy. She is watching from his apartment, but instead of the brightly lit, simple studio flat that we saw before, she is in a strange, dreamy, neon version. She is wearing futuristic clothes.

Emmy watches Tao with great care as he goes about his day in New York. She laughs when he laughs, is angry when he meets a girl. When he buys Ambien at the library, she looks concerned. She tidies his apartment, and tries to get closer to him by touching the screen. Then events in the room begin to mirror his actions. He stops to look at some dogs in a pet shop window, and suddenly there are four dogs in the room with Emmy. He finds a picture in the street, and suddenly she is putting it up on the wall. It feels like she is his stalker, but it also feels like she is existing in a hyper real version of his life.

At the end of the video, Tao returns to the apartment, and leaves the lo fi webcam footage. The apartment is the same as when he left it. Emmy was never there, he imagined her.

This video pays homage to Wong Kar Wai's Chungking Express, and to the Weezer video for Undone: the Sweater Song.
