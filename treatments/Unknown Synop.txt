It starts off with one of the characters knocking over a box of old photos; one of the photos is of her and her friend at the beach. The picture turns into a video and we see all of the memories that she is thinking of from her day at the beach. The video then turns back into a picture and we see the girl smiling as she remembers everything from that day.

It then cuts to the other character walking past a desk where there is a framed picture of her and her friend in a forest. The picture turns into a video and we see all of her memories from their day out in the forest. The video turns into a picture again and she puts the photo back down on the desk. She then gets out her phone and calls her old friend.

The two characters both meet up again and reminisce in the old memories of the adventures that they went on together.
