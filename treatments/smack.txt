Initially you have the perspective of an unknown and apparently lawless entity that uses drugs, has
appalling purple satin sheets and enjoys violence, alcohol and breasts. From the harmless
beginnings of shaving and hand-washing, the song very quickly descends into frantic shotting,
cocaine snorting, much boob-grabbing of involuntary women in various clubs and bars, violence
and vomiting, finishing with a graphic and tastefully distasteful stripper sex scene. It spasms and
blurs the way a distorted human mind would, with the correct cocktail of chemical additions. The
funny part is, one naturally assumes that it is viewed from the perspective of a male.. The clip ends
with the stripper (model Teresa May) leaving the rather derelict-looking apartment of
purplesatinsheets and the protagonist looking into the mirror briefly before passing out, revealing
that ‘he’ is actually a young, Courtney Love-esque, busty blonde female.
