The music video starts with Catastrophe (Taylor Swift) fighting off a group of men wearing suits in an office in London, for a mysterious briefcase, while Arsyn (Selena Gomez) is seen wearing black tights and high heels and beating men by arm bending and hitting them with her black heels. When all of the men are defeated, Arsyn double crosses Catastrophe by stealing the briefcase in Catastrophe's hand and kicking her out of a window. The song begins with Catastrophe lying on a broken car, as Welvin da Great (Kendrick Lamar) begins to rap his verse and Lucky Fiori (Lena Dunham) smokes a cigar. Catastrophe is shown being nursed back to health by a trio of girls called The Trinity (all played by Hailee Steinfeld), and after some time, she is ready to start training for her revenge. The other characters in the video are shown in succession, some in training with Catastrophe.

When her training is complete, Catastrophe and her friends exact their revenge on Arsyn and her henchwomen. The two teams approach each other in what seems to be slow motion while an enormous explosion goes off in the background, blotting out the London skyline, including 30 St Mary Axe, and the video ends with both of the girls simultaneously striking each other.
