Our lead character discovers her husband held hostage in the drawing room. The villains spot her and we cue the music as she runs away in slow motion. She barricades herself in the study where she discovers an ornate time travel device that looks like a glove. As the music counts down from 10, different versions of herself appear around her, all wearing the time machine glove. As the thugs burst in, she activates the glove and travels three minutes back in time. She has to rescue her husband and discover what is going on.
