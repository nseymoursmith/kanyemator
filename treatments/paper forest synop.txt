The video opens on a shot of a mother and daughter walking through a forest together.
Just a simple shot of them holding hands on a summers walk.

The daughter stops walking and we cut to a close up of her eyes.
When we pan out, she is one stage and the shots are of glaring lights, a crowds faces, a sea of people.
Close ups of her ballet shoes and hands curling with nerves, then quickly cut to a wide shot from the back of a school hall.

She stands alone on stage and seems frozen in the spotlight.

She closes her eyes and opens them again, suddenly shes in a opening in a forest
Light rays pour through the trees and she is totally alone, but still in her ballet outfit.

She starts to dance and she is amazing, flying through the forest.

We cut back to the school hall and she is on stage dancing, eyes closed and the crowd are in awe.

Cut between the hall and the forest intermittently.
She finishes dancing and opens her eyes to a slow motion crowd going wild with applause.
The final shot is of the girl and mother walking away from the camera into the forest.
