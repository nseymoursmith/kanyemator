The video begins when Lovato visits a carnival. The video later follows the love story of a young American couple (portrayed by Dustin Milligan and Aimee Teegarden). Initially, the video shows the pair throughout their dating phase. One day, the boy must leave, and it is revealed he is a soldier being deployed in the middle of the war. He promises to return, and meanwhile, the girl is left alone at home. The two attempt to stay in contact by writing letters to one another, and the girl anxiously awaits his correspondence. The next scene shows a flashback to the carnival from the beginning of the video, where the girl hangs out with her friends until she sees the boy for the first time, working at the carnival and the boy follows her around the carnival. The climax of the story portrays a chaotic scene with the boy in a battlefield, shots ringing all around him. Simultaneously, the girl begins to shut herself in her room, worried about her boyfriend, and it seems as if he will die. In the end, the boy returns and reunites with his girlfriend.
