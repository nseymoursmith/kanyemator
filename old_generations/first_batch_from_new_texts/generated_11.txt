In a lone dude , Steinman is the camera zooms in Lovato , a letter based in poker and board games . the walls are inspired in someone by Alice 's Adventures in California , Barcelona and the New Year , and the board game Candy Land , with little of the forest decorated with dancers , sex acts , fashion model , and statues . Times Square appears in a pitch-dark as The band named `` Wrecking Ball '' that is holding purple satin sheets Queens of Candyfornia  captive throughout a king , using candy related devices to hold them . Steinman moves around , experimenting with matches . She moves through a nod , making nuts and freeing The girls . In the place , she appears lying down on the hotel room scene , naked . Times Square tries to block his lyrics in involuntary women . When all the women are free , Steinman leads them in no matter on a building . Seeing The girls freed , `` Wrecking Ball '' becomes enraged , marching on The girls 's desire with a stop of white images . Steinman , dressed in an animated Brandon Flowers like it\u2019 , quickly defeats another outfit with fast food restaurants attached to their lives , after which a human heart throws down his staff and surrenders . the study ends with `` Wrecking Ball '' buried up to his back in a stereo by The girls , nonetheless admiring their day and the exit to the Beach Boys song  together that objects everywhere could be California girls . Rob Ford landmarks appear in a pitch-dark , such as the Sacred Heart of Gaga , the Chocolate Factory and some West Coast beaches which were all made out of resignation .
