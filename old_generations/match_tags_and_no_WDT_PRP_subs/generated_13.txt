crack cocaine features romantic attention of Flowers emotionally singing to the cemetery against a booze-soaked rager , having been inspired by the film version for `` O.J Compares one scene '' by ScHoolboy Q . Interspersed throughout are eyes of Flowers licking a werewolf and swinging on a wrecking ball . At first , she is shown dressed in a city street , aerobics and Doc Martens boots ; as a flashback progresses , she is then shown wearing only the cops .
