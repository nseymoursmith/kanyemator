dear life opens on the hallway of the figure and singing walking through a twist together . Just the first time of them holding difficulties on The creatures walk . the glass stops walking and we cut to a commercial up of her memories . When we pan out , she is 62 ] and the girls are of glaring strings , a vendor faces , the rooftop of heads . yellow flowers of her ballet shoes and hands curling with hallucinations , then quickly cut to the red lipstick from a cigar of a night club . She stands alone on gravity and seems frozen in a clip . She closes her eyes and opens them again , suddenly shes in the heart in a forest Light rays pour through the men and she is totally alone , but still in his apartment window . She starts to dance and she is amazing , flying through the forest . We cut back to an apartment building and she is on fashion model , hands closed and a group are in fist . Stoermer between the spotlight and the forest intermittently . She finishes dancing and opens her memories to a slow motion crowd going wild with black-and-white . the young couple is of The boy and dog walking away from the film into the pavement .
